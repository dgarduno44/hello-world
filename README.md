A quarterback's statistics, such as QBR, touchdown-to-interception ratio, and completion percentage, often correlate with their team's winning percentage, reflecting their impact on game outcomes.

### How to Run Program 
Write the Python code for analyzing quarterback stats and save it as a .py file
Ensure your data (like CSV files) is in the correct format for the program to read
Open the command line, navigate to the directory of your file, and run the program using python qb_analysis.py
